    <h3>Who this is for</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You're a founder/CEO who doesn't have a software background, but want to build and lead a world-class tech company.</li>
      <li>You want to be an EFFECTIVE and CONFIDENT tech CEO — having intelligent discussions with engineers, asking the right questions, and being able to make informed decisions at the highest level.</li>
      <li>You don't have time to become an engineer yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Why this program</h3>
    <p>The old way to become <em>tech fluent</em> was to learn to code or some other kind of intense education. That's great for people who want to become professional engineers, but not for 99% of leaders.</p>
    <p><em>Tech Fluent CEO</em> is the new way. It helps you build <em>technical intuition</em> instead of programming chops. Just like you probably have a strong working knowledge of finance and economics and can have long strategic discussions with your CFO (even if you're not a "finance" person), I'll get you to that level of "fluency" with your CTO / chief IT or digital person.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>How to start</h3>
    <h4>Option 1: Free / 10 USD</h4>
    <p>Read my book, <em><a href="https://aman-agarwal.com/tfc">Tech Fluent CEO</a></em> — I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's the MOST VALUABLE resource you'll ever find as a non-technical entrepreneur. And it only takes a few hours to read.</p>
    <p>$10 if you can afford it, $0 if you can't.</p>
    <h4>Option 2: 15,000 USD</h4>
    <p>I offer personalized training for a small group of CEOs, where you'll directly practice the skills and frameworks that you can use EVERY DAY to be an effective tech CEO: eg: interviewing engineers of different kinds, managing them the right way so you don't burn all your time and money away, navigating complex technical discussions, and plenty of other good stuff — as well as learn from other serious entrepreneurs on the same journey as you.</p>
    <p>They don't teach this stuff at Harvard Business School, or in any engineering management degree, in a McKinsey workshop, or at any coding bootcamp. You will not find this stuff anywhere else because I invented this program myself.</p>
    <p>To get started, <a href="https://calendly.com/mngrwl/interview-private">book a call with me here</a>. In this call, we will go over any questions you may have, and then dive into your business idea a little bit, so that I can tweak the program for you if needed.</p>
    <p>(P.S. I still recommend reading the book first — at least the first 4 chapters.)</p>

      <h3>Coaching FAQs</h3>
      <strong>How long is the program?</strong>
      The core program will take ~3 months (1-3 hours per week).<br>
      You won't have to "wait" for results — from Day 1, you'll immediately start applying what you learned. You can go faster than the rest of the group if you like.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Why is there a call to talk about my business? Can't I just pay and join the group?</strong>
      The true value of a group is in who's NOT in it. I want to make sure your peers are real, legit tech company founders like yourself, whom you can learn from. This unfortunately means no "business coaches," consultants, or agencies in the group.
      <br>
      The agenda for the meeting is to understand what kind of company you're building, and whether this program is right for you.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The coaching price seems low — what kind of CEOs is this for?
      </strong>
      I like Warren Buffett's rule: if you take someone's money, make sure they walk away thinking they got a bargain. This also helps me include slightly earlier-stage startup founders who only just raised funding, etc.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The price seems too high — can I get a discount? Or is there a payment plan?
      </strong>
      Unfortunately not. I can recommend the book instead — it's just what you need, and you can even get it for free if you can't afford it.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Will I learn to code, or use no-code tools like Bubble?
      </strong>
      No and no. Coding skills aren't necessary to build technical intuition. App-builders / no-code tools also fall into the same bucket — they won't get you any closer to building real digital companies and hiring engineers who write code.
      <br><br>
      <strong>What is the learning experience like?</strong>
      A mix of hand-holding and tough love. Expect a lot of real-world practice and being put in the hot seat sometimes.
      The rigor will be just out of your comfort zone to keep it interesting, but never overwhelming.
      The classes will be in a group format, but you will also get to do some 1-1s with me on the side.
      <br><br>
      <strong>How will I access the course?
      </strong>It will be over Google Classroom and Zoom. I will release the learning material (lectures, quizzes, assignments) on the class homepage periodically. You won't need to download any software for this program.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Can I get training/workshops for my whole team?</strong>
      I only have enough time and energy to work with CEOs/entrepreneurs directly, because I'm a CEO myself and I understand their struggles and motivations on a much deeper level. If you want a short workshop or seminar on a specific topic from the program, we can talk about that. Otherwise, the only option is to buy bulk copies of the book for the rest of your team.
