    <h3>Who is this for</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You're a founder/CEO who doesn't have a software background, but want to build and lead a world-class digital company.</li>
      <li>You want to have intelligent discussions with engineers, ask the right questions, and be able to make informed decisions at the highest level as a tech CEO.</li>
      <li>You don't have time to become an engineer yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Why this program</h3>
    <p>The old way to become <em>tech fluent</em> was to learn to code or some other kind of intense education. That's great for people who want to <em>become</em> professional engineers, but not for the other 90% of people.</p>
    <p>This program is the <em>new</em> way. Just like you probably have a strong working knowledge of finance and economics and can have long strategic discussions with your CFO (even if you're not a finance person), I'll get you to that level of "tech fluency" with your chief IT or digital person.</p>
