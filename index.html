    <h3>Who is this for</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You're a founder/CEO who doesn't have a software background, but want to build and lead a world-class digital company.</li>
      <li>You want to have intelligent discussions with engineers, ask the right questions, and be able to make informed decisions at the highest level as a tech CEO.</li>
      <li>You don't have time to become an engineer yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Why this program</h3>
    <p>The old way to become <em>tech fluent</em> was to learn to code or some other kind of intense education. That's great for people who want to <em>become</em> professional engineers, but not for the other 90% of people.</p>
    <p>This program is the <em>new</em> way. Just like you probably have a strong working knowledge of finance and economics and can have long strategic discussions with your CFO (even if you're not a finance person), I'll get you to that level of "tech fluency" with your chief IT or digital person.</p>

      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <strong>How long is the program?</strong>
      The core program will take ~3 months (1-3 hours per week). 
      You won't have to "wait" for results — from Day 1, you'll immediately start applying what you learned. You can go faster than the rest of the group if you like.

      <strong>Why is there an interview?</strong>
      The true value of a group is in who's NOT in it. I want to make sure your peers are real, serious CEOs / entrepreneurs like yourself, whom you can learn from.

      <strong>The price seems a bit low. Why is that?
      </strong>
      I like Warren Buffett's rule: if you take someone's money, make sure they walk away thinking they got a bargain. This price will increase over time.

      <strong>Will I learn to code?
      </strong>
      No. Coding skills aren't necessary to build technical intuition. If you are really interested, I recommend FreeCodeCamp.org or Code.org to get high-quality instruction for free.

      <strong>Will I learn to use no-code tools like Bubble?
      </strong>
      No. These tools won't get you any closer to building real digital companies and hiring engineers who write code.

      <strong>What is the learning experience like?</strong>
      A mix of hand-holding and tough love. Expect a lot of real-world practice and being put in the hot seat sometimes.

      The rigor will be just out of your comfort zone to keep it interesting, but never overwhelming.

      <strong>How will I access the course?
      </strong>It will be over Google Classroom and Zoom. I will release the learning material (lectures, quizzes, assignments) on the class homepage periodically. You won't need to download any software for this program.

      <strong>Can I get training/workshops for my whole team?</strong>
      I only have enough time and energy to work with entrepreneurs directly, but you can buy bulk copies of the book for the rest of your team.

      <strong>I have another question.</strong>
      If it's about "whether it will work for you," please read my <a href="https://aman-agarwal.com/tfc">book</a> first. If you've already decided to join and have a logistical question, book the meeting and ask me there.
