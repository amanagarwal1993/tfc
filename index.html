    <h3>Who this is for</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>You're a founder/CEO who doesn't have a software background, but want to build and lead a world-class tech company.</li>
      <li>You want to be an EFFECTIVE and CONFIDENT tech CEO — having intelligent discussions with engineers, asking the right questions, and being able to make informed decisions at the highest level.</li>
      <li>You don't have time to become an engineer yourself.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Why this program</h3>
    <p>The old way to become <em>tech fluent</em> was to learn to code or some other kind of intense education. That's great for people who want to <em>become</em> professional engineers, but not for the other 90% of people.</p>
    <p><em>Tech Fluent CEO</em> is the new way. Just like you probably have a strong working knowledge of finance and economics and can have long strategic discussions with your CFO (even if you're not a finance person), I'll get you to that level of "tech fluency" with your CTO / chief IT or digital person.</p>

    <h3>How to start</h3>
    <h4>Option 1: Free / 10 USD</h4>
    <p>Read my book, <em><a href="https://aman-agarwal.com/tfc">Tech Fluent CEO</a></em> — I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's the MOST VALUABLE resource you'll ever find as a non-technical entrepreneur. And it only takes a few hours to read.</p>
    <p>$10 if you can afford it, $0 if you can't.</p>
    <h4>Option 2: 15,000 USD</h4>
    <p>Join my <a href="https://calendly.com/mngrwl/interview-private">special training</a>, where you'll practice and sharpen the skills you'll need EVERY DAY as an effective tech CEO: hiring the RIGHT engineers for your purpose, managing them the right way so you don't burn all your time and money away, navigating complex technical discussions, and plenty of other good stuff — as well as learn from other serious entrepreneurs on the same journey as you.</p>
    <p>They don't teach this stuff in any MBA or coding bootcamp etc. You will not find this stuff anywhere else (if you do, they're likely a copycat) because I invented this program myself.</p>
    <p>(P.S. I still recommend reading the book first — it will give you almost everything you need, really.)</p>

      <h3>Coaching FAQs</h3>
      <strong>How long is the program?</strong>
      The core program will take ~3 months (1-3 hours per week).<br>
      You won't have to "wait" for results — from Day 1, you'll immediately start applying what you learned. You can go faster than the rest of the group if you like.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Why is there an "application"?</strong>
      The true value of a group is in who's NOT in it. I want to make sure your peers are real, legit tech company founders like yourself, whom you can learn from. This unfortunately means no "business coaches," consultants, or agencies in the group.
      <br>
      The agenda for the meeting is to simply understand what kind of company you're building, and whether this program is right for you.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The coaching price seems a bit low compared to the value it promises — what kind of CEOs is this really for?
      </strong>
      I like Warren Buffett's rule: if you take someone's money, make sure they walk away thinking they got a bargain. This also helps me include slightly earlier-stage startup founders who only just raised funding, etc.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The price seems too high, can I get a discount?
      </strong>
      Unfortunately no — but if I had to guess, you're probably still a long way off from starting a tech company anytime soon. For you, I recommend the book instead — it's just what you need.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Will I learn to code?
      </strong>
      No. Coding skills aren't necessary to build technical intuition. If you are really interested, I recommend FreeCodeCamp.org or Code.org to get high-quality instruction for free.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Will I learn to use no-code tools like Bubble?
      </strong>
      No. These tools won't get you any closer to building real digital companies and hiring engineers who write code.
      <br><br>
      <strong>What is the learning experience like?</strong>
      A mix of hand-holding and tough love. Expect a lot of real-world practice and being put in the hot seat sometimes.

      The rigor will be just out of your comfort zone to keep it interesting, but never overwhelming.
      <br><br>
      <strong>How will I access the course?
      </strong>It will be over Google Classroom and Zoom. I will release the learning material (lectures, quizzes, assignments) on the class homepage periodically. You won't need to download any software for this program.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Can I get training/workshops for my whole team?</strong>
      I only have enough time and energy to work with entrepreneurs directly, but you can buy bulk copies of the book for the rest of your team.
      <br><br>
      <strong>I have another question.</strong>
      If your question is still about "whether it will work for you" etc etc, please read my <a href="https://aman-agarwal.com/tfc">book</a> first. If you're already strongly considering joining but have a logistical question, book the meeting and ask me there.
